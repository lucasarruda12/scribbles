# Scribbles!

I use Vim and Markdown to take notes during my college classes, and I manage them with Git/GitHub. Recently, I started hosting them on GitHub Pages for easier access.

I don't think this repository will be useful to anyone but myself, but GitHub asks for either money or a public repository.

This also comes with a series of scripts and config files that i use to setup a nice little note-taking environment

## Dependencies

Everything is very dependent on the tools that i prefer using. Switching tools require a little setup.

- (Neo)vim  (or another text editor)
- mdbook    (or another markdown pretty-fier)
- git       (or another way to keep things together)
- tmux      (tmux.)
