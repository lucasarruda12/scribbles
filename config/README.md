# Scribbles!

This is a series of scripts and config files that i use to setup a nice little note-taking environment

## Dependencies

My nice little scripts are very dependent on the tools that i prefer using. Switching tools require a little setup.

- (Neo)vim  (or another text editor)
- mdbook    (or another markdown pretty-fier)
- git       (or another way to keep thing together)
- tmux      (tmux.)
