### Text Segmentation

Text sementation is the process of dividig written text into meaningulunits, such as words, sentences or topics.The tem appliesboth to mental proesses used by humans when erading text, and to artificil proess implemented in computers, which are the subject of natural language processing.

see [text segmentation](pln/text-segmentation.md).

### Sentence Boundary Disambiguation

Alsooknonas sentence breaking, sentence boundary detection, and sentencesegmentation, is theproblem in natural languageprocessing of deciding where sentences begin and end. Natural langage processing tools often require their input to be divided into sentences; however, sentence bonudaryidentificatin can be challengin de tothe potentialambiguity of punctuationmarks. 

see [Sentence segmentation](pln/sentence-segmentation.md).

## Tokenization

### Word segmentation

### Lexical analysis

## Text Normalization

Text normalization is the process of transforming text into asingle canonical formthat it might not have had before. Normalizing text before storing or processing it allows for separation of concerns, since input is guaranteed to be consistent before operations are performed on it.

See [Text Normalization](pln/text-normalization.md)

## Lemmatization and Settminng

> In short: Lemmatiation preserves part of speech (dictionary form) and stemming doesn't (word "root")
