A language model is a machine learning model that predicts upcoming words. More formally, a language model assigns aprobability â†’ each possible next word, or equivalently gives a probability distribution over the possible next words

## Generation

One reason to want to predict upcoming words is to choose contextually better words. 

- For example, we can correct grammar os spelling errors like "Everyting has improved" based solely on the fact that _improved_ has a higher probability to occupy the space after _has_.

## Augmentative and Alternative Communication

- People can use AAC systems if they are physically unable to speak or sign but can instead use eye gaze orr other movements to select words from a menu. Word prediction can be used to suggest likely words for the menu.
